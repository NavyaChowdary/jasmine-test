# jasmine-test

Cross Origin Request Security (CORS) should be disabled before running this test. For chrome on windows, we can use the following command to launch chrome "chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:\temp"". Please close all chrome instances before running this command.

I have written the function "isLfieldPresent" in src/APIParsing.js and tested this functionality through spec/APIParsingSpec.js
